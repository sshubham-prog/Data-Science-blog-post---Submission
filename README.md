## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle and Boston AirBnB data to better understand:

1. The drivers of listing prices on AirBnB based on their properties
2. Identify positive and negative reviews of users from their text reviews
3. key factors that determines user experience during their stay?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I have shared a jupyter notebook answering each of these questions step by step with detailed EDA and CRISP-DM analysis.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
